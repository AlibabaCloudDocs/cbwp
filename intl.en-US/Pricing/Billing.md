## Overdue instructions {#section_nfr_4nm_z2b .section}

After an Internet Shared Bandwidth instance is overdue:

-   When the balance of the account \(including cash, vouchers, coupons or pre-authorization and more\) cannot settle the bill, the system determines that the account is overdue.
-   If the account has been overdue for 24 hours, the Internet Shared Bandwidth will be stopped and reserved for another 15 days.
-   If you recharge your overdue bill within the 15 days, the instance will be automatically restarted.
-   If you do not recharge your overdue bill within the 15 days, the instance will be released. The EIPs in the Internet Shared Bandwidth instance will be automatically removed from the instance and restore their original peak bandwidths and billing method.
