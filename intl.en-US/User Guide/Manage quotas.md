# Manage quotas {#task_nfp_g4k_wgb .task}

You can query current quota usage in the VPC console. If the remaining quota number is insufficient for your requirements, you can apply to increase the quota.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Quota Management**.
3.  On the Quota Management page, click the CBWP tab to view the usage of the Internet Shared Bandwidth resources under your account.
4.  To increase the quota, click **Apply** in the **Actions** column to submit a quota increase application. 

    -   **Quantity for Application**: the required maximum number of Elastic IP Addresses \(EIPs\) that can be added to an Internet Shared Bandwidth instance. The quota you apply must be a number that is greater than the current quota.
    -   **Reason for Application**: the detailed reason for application, including the use scenario and the necessity of applying for a quota increase.
    -   **Email**: the email address of the applicant.
5.  Click **OK**. The system automatically determines whether the quota application is reasonable. If it is unreasonable, the application enters a **Rejected** state, and if it is reasonable, **Approved**. If the application is approved, the quota is automatically upgraded to the applied number.

    To view the quota application history, click **Application History** in the **Application History** column.
