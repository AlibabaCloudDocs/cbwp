# Manage quotas {#task_nfp_g4k_wgb .task}

You can query current quota usage in the VPC console. If the remaining quota of a resource is insufficient, you can directly apply for increasing the quota.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Quota Management**. 
3.  On the Quota Management page, select the CBWP tab to view the usage of Internet Shared Bandwidths under the current account. 
4.  Click **Apply** in the **Actions** column if you want to increase the quota. 

    -   **Quantity for Application**: The maximum number of EIPs that you want to add to an Internet Shared Bandwidth. You must enter a number that is larger than the current quota.
    -   **Reason for Application**: Details the reason, scenarios and necessity of the application.
    -   **Mobile/Landline Phone Number**: your phone number.
    -   **Email**: your Email address.
5.  Click **OK**. The system automatically examines whether the application is reasonable. If the application is unreasonable, the application status is **Rejected**. If the application is reasonable, the application status is **Approved**, and the quota is automatically increased to the applied quantity immediately.

    You can click **Application History** in the **Application History** column to view the application history.
