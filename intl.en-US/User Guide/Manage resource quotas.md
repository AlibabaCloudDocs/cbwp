# Manage resource quotas

This topic describes how to query the quota usage of a cloud resource in the Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) console. If the remaining quota is insufficient, you can apply for an increase.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://vpcnext.console.aliyun.com/vpc).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Quota Management**.

3.  On the**Quota Management** page, click the **Shared Bandwidth** tab to view the usage of the EIP bandwidth plans that belongs to the current Alibaba Cloud account.

4.  To increase the quota, click **Submit Application** in the **Actions** column to submit an application.

    -   **Requested Value**: the requested maximum number of elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\) that can be associated with an EIP bandwidth plan.
    -   **Reason**: the detailed reason for the application, including business scenarios and necessity.
    -   **Email**: the email address of the applicant.
5.  Click **OK**.

    The system automatically reviews your application. You can click **History** in the **Actions** column to view the application history and state. If your application is rejected, its state becomes **Rejected**. If your application is approved, its state becomes **Approved** and the new quota takes effect immediately.
