# Associate an EIP with a cloud instance {#task_ujf_wzk_z2b .task}

After adding an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) to an Internet Shared Bandwidth instance, you can associate the EIP with a cloud instance. With Internet Shared Bandwidth, you can manage the Internet traffic for your cloud resources associated with EIPs in a centralized way and use a peak bandwidth at the Gbit/s level.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://vpcnext.console.aliyun.com).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Internet Shared Bandwidth**.
3.  Select the region of the target Internet Shared Bandwidth instance.
4.  On the Internet Shared Bandwidth page, find the target Internet Shared Bandwidth instance, and click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.
5.  On the Shared Bandwidth IPs page, find the target EIP and click **Bind** in the **Actions** column.
6.  On the Bind Elastic IP Address page, select the instance type and ID to associate, and then click **OK**. For more information, see [Associate an EIP with a cloud instance](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Associate an EIP with a cloud instance/Associate an EIP with a NAT Gateway.md#).
