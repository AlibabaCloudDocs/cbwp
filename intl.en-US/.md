# What is an EIP bandwidth plan?

EIP bandwidth plans support regional bandwidth sharing and reuse. After you purchase an EIP bandwidth plan, you can associate one or more EIPs in the same region with the EIP bandwidth plan. This allows you to manage Internet traffic in a centralized way, and ensures a maximum bandwidth at the Gbit/s level.

## Line types

EIP bandwidth plans support two line types: BGP \(Multi-ISP\) and BGP \(Multi-ISP\)\_PRO. The following table lists the differences:

|Item|BGP \(Multi-ISP\)|BGP \(Multi-ISP\)\_PRO|
|----|-----------------|----------------------|
|Line types of EIPs supported by EIP bandwidth plans|EIPs of BGP \(Multi-ISP\)|EIPs of BGP \(Multi-ISP\)\_PRO|
|Available regions|All regions|China \(Hong Kong\) only|

## Benefits

-   Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) lines with ultra-high bandwidth

    Up to 89 high-quality BGP lines are provided on a global scale. These BGP lines can provide ultra-high bandwidth at a level same as Taobao and Tmall.

-   Centralized management of Internet traffic

    After you purchase an EIP bandwidth plan, you can associate EIPs in the same region with the EIP bandwidth plan. After the EIPs are associated with the EIP bandwidth plan, they function as public IP addresses and share the bandwidth of the EIP bandwidth plan. This way, you can manage and monitor Internet traffic in a centralized manner.
