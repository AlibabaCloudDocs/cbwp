# Limits

This topic describes the limits on EIP bandwidth plans.

## Resource quotas

The following table describes the quotas of EIP bandwidth plans.

|Item|Limit|Adjustable|
|----|-----|----------|
|The number of pay-as-you-go EIP bandwidth plans that can be created with an account in each region|5|N/A|
|The number of elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\) that can be associated with each EIP bandwidth plan|100|You can increase the quota on the [Quota Management page](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/quota). For more information, see [Manage quotas](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Manage quotas.md). |

## Bandwidth limits

EIPs that are associated with an EIP bandwidth plan share the bandwidth of the EIP bandwidth plan. The total amount of bandwidth that is used by the associated EIPs can reach the maximum bandwidth of the EIP bandwidth plan only when the EIP bandwidth plan is applied to more than one connection.

Limits on inbound and outbound bandwidth

-   Inbound bandwidth: The system allocates bandwidth that equals the maximum bandwidth of the bandwidth plan for inbound traffic.
-   Outbound bandwidth: The system allocates bandwidth that equals the maximum bandwidth of the bandwidth plan for outbound traffic.

For example, if the maximum bandwidth of the EIP bandwidth plan that you purchase is 5 Gbit/s, inbound and outbound traffic can be transmitted at a maximum of 5 Gbit/s.

**Note:** In some cases, the actual bandwidth that the EIP bandwidth plan allocates may be higher than the specified maximum bandwidth. However, these cases will be rarer as the service upgrades. To avoid business interruption, we recommend that you set the maximum bandwidth to a value higher than your business requirements when you purchase an EIP bandwidth plan.
