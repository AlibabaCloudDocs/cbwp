## Benefits {#section_vw4_lul_6g5 .section}

-   Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) paths with high bandwidth and high quality
    -   Up to 89 high-quality BGP paths are available around the globe. You can experience a BGP multi-path bandwidth as high as that of Taobao and Tmall.
    -   The bandwidth of an Internet Shared Bandwidth instance can reach 100 Gbit/s.
-   Centralized management of Internet traffic

    You can add an EIP to an Internet Shared Bandwidth instance from the same region. The EIP then becomes a pure public IP address and uses the bandwidth of the Internet Shared Bandwidth instance. In this way, you can manage and monitor Internet traffic in an easier and centralized manner.
